# The Impact of Early Marriage on Literacy and Education Attainment in Africa
_The objective of this project is to practice on exploratory and explanatory data analysis through the use of effective visualizations on Tableau. The project uses the World Development Indicators dataset, which focuses on the marriage and education indicators in different regions._


**Big Idea**:

While 96% of countries have laws that identify the legal age for marriage, there are still countries that do not specify a minimum age and most are African countries. According to the UN, even some countries that do have laws grant exemptions using require courts or parental permission to let minors to wed.  Early marriage not only exposes girls to sexual exploitation and violence, but it also denies their right of education and future opportunities. Therefore, countries that are suffering from low educational level of women must enforce policies that specify a minimum age for marriage (at least 18) and which allow no exemptions.
